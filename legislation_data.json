Australia is one of a number of countries which seeks positive change around the world by supplementing United Nations Security Council sanctions and stepping in when the Security Council is unable to act. The Australian Government currently implements autonomous sanctions, including targeted financial sanctions – through a range of legislative instruments. The Autonomous Sanctions Act creates a legislative framework for Australia's autonomous sanctions measures. The Act gives Australia greater scope and flexibility to apply targeted pressure on oppressive and destabilising regimes across the globe, while minimising the adverse impact on the people of those nations. The Act improves Australia's capacity to respond quickly to issues of international concern such as in the case of Iran or North Korea. The Act also assists the administration of, and compliance with, sanctions measures by removing distinctions between the scope and extent of autonomous sanctions and UN sanction enforcement laws.",
